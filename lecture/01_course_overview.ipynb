    "\n",
    "## 0.1 Why This Course Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite missions generate data at an unprecedented scale and complexity.  \n",
    "Yet the hardest part of working with satellite payload data is rarely the volume — it is **understanding what the data actually represents**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is built on a simple premise:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Good payload data processing begins long before data reaches the ground.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most data science courses start with an existing dataset and ask:  \n",
    "*How do we analyze this?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, satellite missions force us to ask a deeper question:\n",
    "\n",
    "*How did this data come into existence in the first place — and how do our assumptions shape what we see?*\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer that, we must treat **payload simulation and ground processing as a single system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.2 Conceptual Foundation: The Data Science Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "The conceptual backbone of this course is the **data science lifecycle**, as presented in *Learning Data Science* (Lau, Gonzalez, Nolan, O’Reilly, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "The lifecycle consists of four high-level stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ask a Question**  \n",
    "2. **Obtain Data**  \n",
    "3. **Understand the Data**  \n",
    "4. **Understand the World**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many tool-driven approaches, this framework emphasizes *thinking* over implementation details.  \n",
    "This course adopts the same philosophy — but adapts it to **satellite payload systems**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.3 Mapping the Lifecycle to Satellite Missions\n",
    "\n",
    "In satellite data processing, the lifecycle looks different — but the logic is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Science Lifecycle | Satellite Mission Interpretation |\n",
    "|-----------------------|----------------------------------|\n",
    "| Ask a Question | Mission objectives and science requirements |\n",
    "| Obtain Data | Payload design, sensing physics, simulation |\n",
    "| Understand the Data | Calibration, processing, exploration |\n",
    "| Understand the World | Scientific inference and interpretation |\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, **“obtaining data” does not start after launch**.  \n",
    "It starts with **forward models and simulators** that define what the sensor *can* and *cannot* observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why simulation is not optional in payload data science — it is foundational.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.4 Observational Data and Instrument Mediation\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite payload data is **observational**, not experimental.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not control:\n",
    "- the atmosphere,\n",
    "- the surface,\n",
    "- the illumination geometry,\n",
    "- or many aspects of the measurement process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every value in a payload data product is the result of:\n",
    "- physical processes,\n",
    "- instrument response,\n",
    "- onboard processing,\n",
    "- ground processing algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book emphasizes that data must always be interpreted **in the context of how it was collected**.  \n",
    "For satellite data, this context is inseparable from the instrument itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.5 Why Simulation Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation allows us to **separate truth from measurement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By generating synthetic payload data, we can:\n",
    "- start from a known physical reality,\n",
    "- model how the payload observes it,\n",
    "- inject noise, bias, and limitations deliberately,\n",
    "- process the data through a ground chain,\n",
    "- and compare outputs to known truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mirrors a key idea from *Learning Data Science*:  \n",
    "understanding data means understanding **scope, bias, and uncertainty**, not just numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In satellite missions, simulation is how we:\n",
    "- validate algorithms before launch,\n",
    "- design calibration strategies,\n",
    "- explore failure modes,\n",
    "- and quantify uncertainty honestly.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 0.6 The Role of Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is delivered entirely through **Jupyter notebooks** because they support:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Narrative explanation  \n",
    "- Executable code  \n",
    "- Visual diagnostics  \n",
    "- Reproducibility  \n",
    "\n",
    "This reflects how real payload algorithms are developed and validated:\n",
    "iteratively, transparently, and with constant feedback between assumptions and results.\n",

    "\n",
    "### This course **is**:\n",
    "- A systems-level view of payload data processing\n",
    "- A bridge between physics, simulation, and data science\n",
    "- Focused on reasoning, not button-pushing\n",
    "- Explicit about uncertainty and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### This course **is not**:\n",
    "- A generic machine learning course\n",
    "- A remote sensing cookbook\n",
    "- A black-box pipeline tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "As emphasized in *Learning Data Science*, techniques matter less than **understanding when and why they apply**.\n",

    "## 0.8 Course Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain how payload data is generated, not just processed  \n",
    "2. Build simple but meaningful payload data simulations  \n",
    "3. Process synthetic and real satellite data through ground chains  \n",
    "4. Identify sources of bias, uncertainty, and misinterpretation  \n",
    "5. Reason about satellite-derived conclusions responsibly  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.9 Where We Go Next\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Lecture 1**, we will formalize the data science lifecycle specifically for satellite missions and introduce the **end-to-end mental model** that will guide the rest of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we move *forward* — from physical reality to synthetic payload data.\n",
