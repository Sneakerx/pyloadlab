    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern satellite missions do not begin with data analysis — they begin with **models**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long before a sensor is launched, engineers and scientists simulate how a payload will interact with the physical world: how radiation propagates through the atmosphere, how a detector responds to incoming signals, how noise, bias, and degradation are introduced, and how raw measurements are transformed into geophysical products on the ground. These simulations are not an academic exercise; they are essential to mission design, calibration strategies, algorithm development, and risk reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course treats **payload data simulation and ground data processing as a single, continuous system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than viewing satellite data as something that simply “appears” after launch, we adopt an **end-to-end perspective**:  \n",
    "from physical reality → sensor → onboard processing → downlink → ground processing → scientific interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lecture series is to introduce **data science principles through the full lifecycle of satellite payload data**, including both **synthetic data generation** and **realistic processing chains**. We will simulate payload measurements, inject known errors and uncertainties, and process the resulting data using the same techniques applied to real missions. By doing so, we gain a deeper understanding of *why* processing steps exist, not just *how* to implement them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We work primarily in **Jupyter notebooks**, combining explanatory text, executable Python code, simulations, and visualizations. This interactive format mirrors how payload algorithms are designed and validated in practice: iteratively, transparently, and with tight feedback loops between assumptions and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the course, we will emphasize:\n",
    "- Payload data as **observational, instrument-mediated measurements**\n",
    "- The role of **forward models** in understanding sensor behavior\n",
    "- The distinction between **physical truth**, **measured signal**, and **derived product**\n",
    "- How **bias, noise, resolution, and sampling** propagate through processing chains\n",
    "- Reproducibility and traceability in scientific software\n",
    "\n",
    "A central theme of this course is that **simulation is not the opposite of reality** — it is a tool for reasoning about it. By constructing synthetic payload data with known properties, we can:\n",
    "- Validate ground processing algorithms\n",
    "- Quantify uncertainty and sensitivity\n",
    "- Explore edge cases rarely seen in operational data\n",
    "- Build confidence in mission performance before launch\n",
    "\n",
    "While examples will focus on satellite payloads and Earth Observation systems, the ideas extend beyond space missions. Any system that relies on indirect measurement through complex instruments benefits from the same discipline: explicit modeling, careful processing, and honest interpretation of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Design simple but meaningful payload data simulations\n",
    "2. Generate synthetic sensor measurements with realistic imperfections\n",
    "3. Build and apply ground processing chains to simulated and real data\n",
    "4. Analyze how assumptions propagate through the end-to-end system\n",
    "5. Communicate results with appropriate physical and statistical context\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a course about pressing buttons or running black-box pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a course about **building, simulating, and reasoning about data systems that observe the Earth from space**.\n"
